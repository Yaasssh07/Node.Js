Project Documentation: Node.js CI/CD with Docker and Kubernetes


Objective
The goal of this project was to create an automated CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes. The pipeline automatically runs tests on every pull request, builds and pushes Docker images, and deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, the project includes real-time deployment notifications via Slack.

Project Breakdown
1. Initial Setup and Development
The project started by creating a basic Node.js application, which includes API routes and necessary application logic. The code was then added to a GitHub repository to take advantage of GitHub’s version control system.

The first step was to set up a simple Node.js app, ensuring it had basic functionality for testing purposes.
A Dockerfile was created to containerize the Node.js application, making it environment-independent.
Kubernetes configuration files, such as deployment.yaml and service.yaml, were created to define how the application should be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.





2. GitHub Actions Workflow
A key component of this project is the GitHub Actions workflow, which automates the CI/CD pipeline. The workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch and on every pull request. Here’s an outline of the steps followed in the workflow:

Code Checkout: The workflow first checks out the latest code from the repository.
Set up Node.js: The workflow then sets up the required Node.js environment to run tests.
Install Dependencies: Dependencies for the Node.js application are installed.
Test Execution: Automated tests are executed to ensure the application is working as expected.
Docker Image Build: The application is built into a Docker image, and it is tagged with the latest Git commit hash to maintain a versioned history.
Push Docker Image: The Docker image is pushed to a Docker repository (DockerHub) to store the image for future use in Kubernetes.
Kubernetes Deployment: The image is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl tool, which interacts with the Kubernetes API to create the required deployments and services.
Slack Notification: The final step sends a notification to a Slack channel to notify team members of the deployment’s success or failure.







3. Docker Setup
Docker is used to containerize the Node.js application, allowing it to run consistently across different environments. The Dockerfile contains the necessary instructions to package the application, including installing dependencies and setting up the runtime environment for the Node.js app.

By containerizing the app, I ensured that it could be easily deployed on any system that supports Docker.
DockerHub was used as the container registry to store the Docker images, making it easy to pull and deploy the images on Kubernetes.




4. Kubernetes Deployment
Kubernetes was used for orchestrating the deployment of the Docker container. The Kubernetes configuration consists of a deployment.yaml file, which defines the application’s deployment settings, and a service.yaml file to expose the app to external traffic.

The deployment.yaml specifies the number of replicas, the Docker image to use, and the ports for the container.
The service.yaml file exposes the Node.js application on a specific port and ensures that it is accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster.
By using Kubernetes, I ensured that the application could scale easily and that the deployment process would be automated and repeatable.






5. Slack Notification Setup
A critical part of this project was to ensure real-time notifications of the deployment status. To achieve this, I integrated Slack using incoming webhooks. This allowed me to send messages to a predefined Slack channel to inform the team when the deployment was successful or failed.

I created a Slack Incoming Webhook URL and stored it as a GitHub secret to securely pass it to the GitHub Actions workflow.
The webhook sends deployment updates with the status of the build and deployment, helping the team stay informed.





Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions. By automating the testing, building, and deployment processes, the project not only streamlines the deployment workflow but also makes it more reliable and repeatable.

The integration with Slack allows for real-time communication of deployment statuses, ensuring transparency in the process.
